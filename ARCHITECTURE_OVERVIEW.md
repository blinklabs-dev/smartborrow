---

### **Session 9: Advanced Retrieval**
**What We Learned:** Hybrid search, MMR, multi-query retrieval, ensemble methods

**How It's Used in SmartBorrow:**
- **Hybrid Retrieval:** BM25 + dense embeddings for comprehensive search
- **Multi-Query Expansion:** "Pell Grant" ‚Üí "federal aid", "financial need", "EFC"
- **Ensemble Methods:** Combine multiple retrieval strategies
- **Metadata Filtering:** Filter by document type, recency, relevance

**Real Impact:** More relevant, comprehensive answers to user questions

---

### **Session 10: Advanced Agents**
**What We Learned:** Agentic reasoning, tool selection, complex decision making

**How It's Used in SmartBorrow:**
- **Intelligent Routing:** System decides whether to use RAG, web search, or calculation
- **Tool Selection:** Agents choose the right tools for each query type
- **Reasoning Chains:** Multi-step reasoning for complex financial scenarios
- **Fallback Logic:** Robust error handling when agents fail

**Real Impact:** System handles any financial aid question intelligently
